This Android mobile application allows a user to manage point of sale transactions; 
(Wikipedia,07-12-2018) "The point of sale or point of purchase is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.
At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount,
may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment."

It's intended to be quick and easy to use; this is achieved by incorparating Android's intuitive Material Design GUI Components.
